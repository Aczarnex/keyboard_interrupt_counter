INSTRUCTIONS:
	MAKE:
		Make has 3 targets: all, clean and enable. 'make' will prepare files for loading, 
		'make enable' will load the module, clear dmesg log and compile the suerspace 
		app as 'kic'. 'make clean will unload the module and remove non-source files.;

	KIC MODULE:
		Module itself reports on it's workings in dmesg log, should no errors occur 
		messeging will be sparse. Default IRQ line requested by the module is 1. 

	KIC USER:
		Command line app has 2 modes of interaction. It can either be called without
		arguments, upon which it opens a menu with options listed (mutiple queries
		are allowed) or with one of the following arguments: count, time, reset.
		Either argument will cause the app to return only one line of text and exit.
		'count' returns the current count, 'reset' resets the counter and time returns
		the time and date of last reset since loading the module. 

ISSUES:
	> Should the keyboard send IRQs to a different line than 1, a change in 
	  keyboard_interrupt_counter.h will be necessary. IRQ line used is represented by
	  KEYBOARD_IRQ macro. Other modules also need to share this line, module will not 
	  work unless those conditions are met.
