INSTRUCTIONS:
	MAKE:
	Make has multiple targets available to freely access the process, but the
	basic flow is as follows:
	make -> make clean
	'make' without specific targets will build and load the module as well as
	compile the userspace app, while 'make clean' will ensure the module is
	unloaded before removal.

	KIC MODULE:
	The module itself reports on its workings in dmesg log, should no errors
	occur messaging will be sparse. Default Major Device Number requested by
	the module is 420, default IRQ line requested is 1, more on that under
	"issues". Result expected is a count roughly equal to twice the amount of
	button presses generated by the user or more.

	KIC USER:
	The command line app has 2 modes of interaction. It can either be called
	without arguments, upon which it opens a menu with options listed
	(multiple queries are allowed) or with one of the following arguments:
	count, time, reset. Either argument will cause the app to return only one
	line of text and exit. 'count' returns the current count, 'reset' resets
	the counter and 'time' returns the time and date of last reset since
	loading the module.

ISSUES:
	 Should the keyboard send IRQs to a different line than 1, a change in
	kic_module.c will be necessary. IRQ line used is represented by
	KEYBOARD_IRQ macro. Other modules also need to share this irq line, this
	module will not work unless those conditions are met.
	 Should Major Number 420 be unavailable, a new Major number needs to be
	assigned manually. The module itself does not support dynamic assignment.
	Major number is represented by KIC_MAJOR macro in
	keyboard_interrupt_counter.h file.
	 Running the app may require sudo privileges. If the following error
	messege occurs: "Device:/dev/keyboard_interrupt_counter inaccesible or
	missing. Error Code: -1" it is likely the case.
